## Wrangling and Analyzing 
This project is one of the project I did in the online course I attended recently.\
The course is ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.\
The project included Gathering, Assessing, Cleaning, Storing,\
Analyzing, and visualizing data of the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as WeRateDogs. \

## Getting Started
Jupyter Notebooks\
Packages to install:
- Pandas
- NumPy

## TODO
If you need to run the program in local machine familiarize yourself with [tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) library.\
You also need to [sign up](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview) for Twitter Develper account.
